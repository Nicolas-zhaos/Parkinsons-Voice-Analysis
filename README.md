# Parkinsons-s-Voice-Analysis
An attempt to classify Parkinson's Disease based on the extraction of vocal features from patient recordings. 
<hr>

Parkinson’s Disease is progressive nervous system disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. The disease may also affect one’s ability to walk and talk. People may also experience mental and behavioural changes, sleep problems, depression, memory difficulties and fatigue. 

Parkinson’s disease can occur in both men and women, however it is more prevalent amongst men. A major risk factor is age, with most people developing the disease at age 60. 



Notes For Self (Delete):
- Credit the person who made the recorder -- Github
- Only works on Google Chrome and Firefox (Webpage stuff)
- Add link to audio repository
- Add link to Parselmouth Library (+ Credit)
- List python libraries necessary
- Discuss Firebase

Structure for Document (Delete):
- Introduce PD
- Discuss approach (random forest) -- vocal features
- Discuss results -- high accuracy but ineffective in real life (misdiagnosis)
- Discuss resources (i.e audio repository + library)
- Discuss Frontend (Credit Github Link)
- Discuss Backend
- Conclusion -- Improvements are welcome
